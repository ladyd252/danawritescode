A surprising use case for ChatGPT came up while I was building this blog. I was trying to find a couple of fonts to use here, and started scrolling through Google fonts. Either I haven't looked at in a while and completely forgot what it looked like, or they've added an outrageous amount of fonts in that time. Anyway, it was way more fonts than I could scroll through and evaluate visually to determine whether they fit what I had in mind, even using the various filters available. I turned to ChatGPT and it totally delivered. I prompted it with "I'm looking for a google font for a logo. I want it to be thick, a little bit fun but not too flourished. Any suggestions?" and it provided me with 7 options, of which I ended up going with [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee). I also asked it for help finding Google fonts similar to other fonts I've seen on various blogs as well as fonts that would pair well. It did a nice job and saved me a lot of time and overwhelm.
